#    ConformalTracking
#
#    Package for running pattern recognition based on conformal mapping and cellular automaton. This is not
#    tied to a given geometry, but has been developed for the CLIC detector model 2015.

  General:			The package contains a first implementation of a fully hermitic pattern recognition
				using all tracking detectors (developed for the CLIC detector model 2015 containing
				only silicon tracking). Hits from all detectors are considered together, without 
				knowledge of geometry, using a two-dimensional conformal mapping to reduce the track
				search to a straight line search. Cellular automaton is used in this conformal space
				to produce tracks. 

  ConformalTracking:		The main pattern recognition processor. It will try to produce tracks by sequentially
				adding the input hit collections, which should be provided from inner to outer radius.
 
  KDTree and kdtree2:		Implementation of a fast nearest neighbour search algorithm (from BOOST) and a wrapper
				which interfaces the KDHit class.

  KDCluster:			A simple class representing a hit in conformal space. It stores the uv co-ordinates in
				cartesian and polar notation, to allow for angular searches (during seeding) and spatial
				nearest neighbour searches.

  Cell:				The cell class used for cellular automaton. Holds some simple information concerning the
				cell weight, other cells to which it is connected, and the hits from which it is made.
